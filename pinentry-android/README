This is a temporary POC implementation of abstract UNIX domain sockets on
Android using a client in C that connects to a Java server.

The client executes the Java server using the "am start" command

Execute:

(push PINEntry.apk first)

ndk-build 
adb push libs/armeabi/pinentry-android /data/local/tmp/ 
adb shell /data/local/tmp/pinentry-android
